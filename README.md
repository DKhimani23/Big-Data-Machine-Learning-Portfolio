### Week 4: Apache Spark & House Price Regression
- Performed ML regression using Spark MLlib
- Compared tree-based regressors

### Week 5: Building Recommender Systems - Movie Recommendations 
- Built ALS models in Spark
- Scaled from 1K to 20M entries

### Week 6: Deep Learning with ResNet50
- Transfer learning on dog breed and rural/urban image classification
- Compared models with/without augmentation

### Week 7–9: CNN, RNN, and Sentiment Analysis
- Built and tuned deep learning models
- Compared ANN, RNN, LSTM, CNN
